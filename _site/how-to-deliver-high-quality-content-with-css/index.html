      <p>Yesterday I made a joke on Twitter to <a href='https://twitter.com/smashingmag'>@smashingmag</a> saying &#8221;<a href='https://twitter.com/askothecoder/status/271367427089125376'>I suppose <code>(min-connection-speed: 2mb)</code> in CSS would be nice</a>&#8221;. Then <a href='https://twitter.com/smashingmag'>@smashingmag</a> tweeted &#8221;<a href='https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/271368026937511939'>Agree?</a>&#8221; and a ton of opinions followed. Some agreed, most disagreed. Apparently it&#8217;s very unreliable, like mentioned by <a href='https://twitter.com/respimg'>@respimg</a> and therefore will probably never be implemented by any browser.</p>

<p>Today <a href='https://twitter.com/smashingmag'>@smashingmag</a> tweeted &#8221;<a href='https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/271595279315243008'>We&#8217;d love to have this article on SmashingMag as well</a>&#8221;. It was then when I realized that my joke was not really a joke after all. Something I did not even think about - a real issue with delivering content to slow and fast connections differently.</p>

<p>We, front-end developers, have to optimize our images to fit a very tiny size so it would play well with third-world countries where the connection speed has not developed much, but that risks a loss of quality of the images and let&#8217;s be honest, we all would love fast loading, high quality images.</p>

<p>So, a media query that I joked about obviously does not exist. But what does? I started thinking and realized page load times are probably the safest way to go, I&#8217;ll be using PHP and <code>microtime()</code> (which, I&#8217;m pretty sure, can be done in a ton of other languages, too) for the example.</p>
<pre class='highlight'>
$time = microtime();
$time = explode(' ', $time);
$time = $time[1] + $time[0];
$finish = $time;
$total_time = round(($finish - $start), 4);
$too_long = 1;

if($total_time > $too_long){
	// load stylesheet for a slow connection
}else{
	// load stylesheet for a fast connection
}
</pre>
<p>That would, by theory, enable us detect how long did it took for a visitor to load the page and judging by that time, load a stylesheet with either high quality or low quality images. And it&#8217;s not THAT ugly.</p>

<p>However, I&#8217;m really interested in various solutions regarding the subject, so feel free to speak up if you know of any and I will update this article with each reliable and fast method.</p>
