    <p>September 17. It was a late evening and my mom went to get something to snack from the fridge. Unfortunately for her, I really wanted something to snack, too, 
    and so demanded justice by breaking myself out of her stomach. Well, not that brutally. But it did took a painful hour or two in the hospital. About that snack, well,
    I got it a month later because apparently I was born a month too early and had to stay in a glass box for a month. I guess that explains why I'm so awesome.</p>

    <p>First time I saw a PC. My mom had bought one because she needed it for work and figured it would be good for me, too, to not play football all day and do stupid things that parents call "trouble". So, she made me an account on a local
    social network, which I never used, but nevertheless it's my very first time I pressed a key on a thing that would later become my everyday life.</p>

      My uncle retired his old PC and decided to give it to me. It was an awesome machine that didn't even run Counter-Strike, nor had any internet connection for that matter and the best OS it could run was Windows 95. But it did have a floppy drive, which was all I needed. My friend got a PC a few months before I and I knew he had a ton of games, so we traded and traded, but eventually gaming got boring and I wanted something new and interesting.</p>
      
    <p>At some point I decided to be an idiot and click on Internet Explorer on the desktop which resulted in a browser with an error page; "<strong>No internet connection available</strong>". This was the start of the rest of my career. I immediately wanted to know how is this page created and why does it look like this, not like X, Y or Z. </p>
    
    <p>I started visiting the local library to use internet and find out more about that thing called HTML. Soon I got a subdomain and hosting on my friends account and I created my very first website. It had dark blue background, black text and about 40 YouTube embed videos. Yes, it was THAT bad.</p>

    By 2007 I had already mastered the basics of HTML &amp; CSS and had moved on to PHP. It was around then when I got a hold of 
    a social network script, a very broken one at that. I broke it even more for a few times till I got the hang of PHP, but in the end I was able to fix it and share it with the entire world. Which resulted in 80% of all Estonian social networks to run on the script. 80% was a lot, because thanks to me there were over 20 social networks in a country with a population over 1mil.

    Social networks all of a sudden were really popular (I wonder why ...) so I created one, too. A local one of course. It got about 20.000 users in a month, about 600 of those used premium features. It was a good year to almost end. But somewhere around August things started to fall apart, people got inactive, the site got hacked a lot. So, by December I shut it down and collected my winnings and started learning more and more about PHP, Javascript and everything that comes with it.

    I got my very first job at a local start-up AllTime where I was one of the three back-end developers working on one of the very first e-billing environments for Estonia. We finished it in a month and each and everyone of us went different paths.
    </p>
    
    <p>In April I got a job at A2B Group, also a local company, where I was responsible for taking care of about 50 different WordPress installations which included updating plugins that the original authors did no longer do. I also had to modify a couple of Magento &amp; Joomla powered sites. 
    </p>
    
    <p>In September I got hired in <a href="http://ddr.ee">Direct Digital Reach</a> thanks to my friend <a href="http://shiienurm.com">Stefan</a> as a front-end developer. I was responsible for coding a few email campaigns, facebook campaigns and websites.</p>

    I quit my job at Direct Digital Reach in March and moved to Helsinki, Finland with a hope for a more interesting life, whatever that means.
